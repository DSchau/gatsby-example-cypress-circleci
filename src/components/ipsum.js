    <p>
      Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an a priori adjunct of
      non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical imperative is holding
      that ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx claims it
      was offside.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1945, peace broke out. It was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare was
      banned at a special session of the Geneva Convention, and in 1950 the last
      remaining copy of the joke was laid to rest here in the Berkshire
      countryside, never to be told again.
